![Karumi logo][karumilogo] Kata LogIn/LogOut in Swift [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Karumi/KataLogInLogOutSwift.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Karumi/KataLogInLogOutSwift)
============================

- We are here to practice unit testing.
- We are going to use [XCTest][xctest] to interact with the Application UI.
- We are going to practice pair programming.

## Tasks

Your task as iOS Developer is to implement all the tasks described below one by one without skipping any step. 

**This repository is ready to build the application, pass the checkstyle and your tests in Travis-CI environments.**

Our recommendation for this exercise is:

  * Before starting
    1. Create a git repository with an empty iOS app inside.
    2. Configure Travis CI or any other CI tool.
    3. Read the requirements twice.

  
## Tasks

**Important requirement:** Until the testing stage, all the code should be written inside the Activity.

* **Movement 1:** Writing the app.

  * Build an app with only one screen that allows you to log in if the username and the password are equal to ``admin``.
  * After the log in, the user should be able to log out if the log out button is pressed and the second when the button was pressed was even.
  * Add validation for the username field so chars as ``,``, ``.``, and ``;`` are not allowed. Show a toast explaining the error if the username contain these chars.
  * The code to log the user in and out has to been executed out of the main thread.  

* **Movement 2:** Testing the app using just unit tests.

  * Take some time to think about what should you test and how. Did you find any issue with this code that does not let you test it?
  * Using some common testing patterns re-implement part of your app making it testable and start adding coverage. Think twice your changes before start coding and test all the code you move using just unit tests.
  
## Extra Tasks
  
* **Movement 3:** Persist information.

  * Make the app persist the user session and show the UI buttons based on the user persisted session.

**If you get stuck, `master` branch contains the solution for this kata.**
